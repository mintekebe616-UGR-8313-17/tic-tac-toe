}
```

loseSound.volume = 0.5;
drawSound.volume = 0.5;
moveSound.volume = 0.3;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sounds not working?
- Check if files are in `assets` folder
- File names must be exact: `win.mp3`, `lose.mp3`, etc.
- Browser must support MP3
- Click something first (browsers block autoplay)

### Game not loading?

- Don't rename HTML/CSS/JS files
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
